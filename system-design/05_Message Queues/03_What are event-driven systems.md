An **event-driven system** is a software architecture pattern where the **flow of the program is determined by events** — things that happen during execution like user actions, sensor outputs, or system changes.

### 🔄 What is an “Event”?

An **event** is any significant change in state or occurrence in the system, like:

- A user clicks a button
    
- A payment is completed
    
- A new file is uploaded
    
- A sensor sends data

### ⚙️ How Event-Driven Systems Work

An event-driven system typically has **3 main components**:

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|**Event Producer**|Detects or triggers an event (e.g. frontend UI, IoT device, backend service)|
|**Event**|A message that describes what happened (e.g., `order_placed`, `file_uploaded`)|
|**Event Consumer**|Listens for specific events and reacts by executing logic or triggering workflows|

These components are often decoupled using **message brokers** or **event buses**.

### 📦 Example: Online Food Delivery

- **Producer**: Customer places an order → triggers `order_placed`
    
- **Consumers**:
    
    - Restaurant system receives the order
        
    - Notification service sends confirmation
        
    - Analytics service logs the event
        

Each consumer reacts **independently** and can be scaled or replaced without affecting others.

### 🧠 Key Concepts

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Asynchronous**|Events are handled in the background, often with queues or background workers|
|**Decoupled Services**|Producers don’t need to know who is listening|
|**Scalable**|New services can subscribe to events without changing existing logic|
|**Reactive**|System reacts in real-time to what’s happening in the environment or application|

---

### ✅ Benefits

- 📈 **Scalability** – Add or remove consumers independently
    
- 🔧 **Maintainability** – Services are loosely coupled and easier to update
    
- 🧩 **Flexibility** – Easily plug new features (e.g. analytics, logging) by subscribing to events
    
- ⚡ **Responsiveness** – Real-time reactions to system changes

### 🧰 Tools & Tech

|Tool|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Kafka**|Event streaming|High-throughput, fault-tolerant|
|**RabbitMQ**|Message broker|Supports queues and pub/sub|
|**AWS SNS/SQS**|Event pub/sub|Scalable cloud messaging|
|**Redis Streams**|Lightweight event system|Fast and simple|

---

### 📘 Real-World Examples

- **Frontend UI**: Button clicks → trigger animations or data fetches
    
- **Microservices**: Payment complete → notify, generate invoice, update inventory
    
- **IoT Devices**: Motion detected → turn on light, send alert
