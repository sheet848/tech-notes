### **Load Balancing in System Design**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Load Balancing?**

Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. This helps improve system **performance, availability, and reliability**.

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Why is Load Balancing Important?**

- **Scalability** ‚Üí Handles increased traffic efficiently.
    
- **High Availability (HA)** ‚Üí Ensures services remain available even if some servers fail.
    
- **Improved Performance** ‚Üí Reduces latency by distributing requests optimally.
    
- **Fault Tolerance** ‚Üí If one server crashes, traffic is redirected to healthy servers.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ How Load Balancing Works**

1. A **client** makes a request (e.g., accessing a website).
    
2. The **load balancer** receives the request.
    
3. It decides which backend **server** should handle the request based on a chosen strategy.
    
4. The selected **server processes the request** and responds to the client.

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Load Balancers**

There are **three main types** of load balancers:

|Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Hardware Load Balancer**|Dedicated physical device for traffic distribution|F5, Citrix NetScaler|
|**Software Load Balancer**|Runs on commodity hardware or cloud|Nginx, HAProxy, Envoy|
|**Cloud-Based Load Balancer**|Managed by cloud providers|AWS ALB/ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancer|

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Load Balancing Algorithms**

Load balancers use different strategies to distribute traffic:

|Algorithm|Description|Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|**Round Robin**|Sends requests sequentially to each server|Simple & effective when servers have equal capacity|
|**Least Connections**|Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections|Useful for long-lived connections (e.g., WebSockets)|
|**Least Response Time**|Chooses the server with the fastest response time|Good for latency-sensitive applications|
|**IP Hashing**|Maps requests from the same client IP to the same server|Useful for session persistence|
|**Weighted Load Balancing**|Assigns different weights to servers based on capacity|When some servers are more powerful than others|

#### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Load Balancing Techniques**

There are **two main** techniques used in load balancing:

1. **Layer 4 Load Balancing (Transport Layer - TCP/UDP)**
    
    - Distributes traffic based on **IP address and port**.
        
    - Faster but less flexible.
        
    - Example: AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB).
        
2. **Layer 7 Load Balancing (Application Layer - HTTP/HTTPS)**
    
    - Makes routing decisions based on **URL, cookies, headers, content type**.
        
    - Supports advanced features like **SSL termination, caching, and compression**.
        
    - Example: AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB), Nginx, HAProxy.

#### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Load Balancer Deployment Strategies**

1. **Global Load Balancing** ‚Üí Distributes traffic across multiple **geographical locations** (e.g., using DNS-based routing).
    
2. **Regional Load Balancing** ‚Üí Balances traffic within a **data center or cloud region**.
    
3. **Internal Load Balancing** ‚Üí Distributes traffic between **microservices or backend APIs**.

#### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Example**

Imagine an e-commerce site experiencing high traffic during **Black Friday sales**.  
Without a load balancer: ‚ùå **One server crashes due to overload**, making the site slow or unavailable.

With a load balancer: ‚úÖ Traffic is **distributed across multiple servers**, ensuring smooth performance.

#### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Tools Used for Load Balancing**

- **Nginx** (Popular open-source load balancer and reverse proxy)
    
- **HAProxy** (High-performance TCP and HTTP load balancer)
    
- **Envoy** (Modern proxy for microservices architecture)
    
- **Cloud Load Balancers** (AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancer, Azure Load Balancer)

#### **üîπ Summary**

- **Load balancing** distributes traffic across multiple servers to ensure **scalability, high availability, and performance**.
    
- It can be implemented using **hardware, software, or cloud-based solutions**.
    
- Common algorithms include **Round Robin, Least Connections, and IP Hashing**.
    
- Works at **Layer 4 (TCP) and Layer 7 (HTTP)**, depending on requirements.
