# **Sharding in System Design**

## **1️⃣ What is Sharding?**

**Sharding** is a **database partitioning technique** that divides large datasets into **smaller, more manageable pieces (shards)**, each stored on a different server.

✅ **Improves scalability** by allowing parallel processing.  
✅ **Reduces query load** on individual database servers.  
✅ **Enhances fault tolerance** by preventing a single point of failure.

---

## **2️⃣ Why is Sharding Needed?**

In traditional monolithic databases:  
🔴 **Scaling becomes difficult** as data grows.  
🔴 **Reads and writes slow down** due to single-server limitations.  
🔴 **A single failure can bring down the entire system**.

**Sharding solves these problems by distributing data across multiple servers, improving performance and fault tolerance.**

## **3️⃣ How Sharding Works**

1. **Data is divided** based on a **sharding key** (e.g., user ID, location, timestamp).
    
2. Each **shard stores a subset of the data**.
    
3. Queries go to the **specific shard** that contains the required data instead of scanning the entire database.
    

### **Example:**

Imagine a database with **10 million users**. Instead of storing all users in one **huge table**, we **split** them across **multiple shards** based on `user_id`:

|**Shard**|**Users (user_id range)**|**Stored In**|
|---|---|---|
|Shard 1|`1 - 1M`|DB Server A|
|Shard 2|`1M - 2M`|DB Server B|
|Shard 3|`2M - 3M`|DB Server C|

✅ **A query for `user_id = 2,345,678` directly goes to Shard 3**, reducing query time.

## **4️⃣ Types of Sharding Strategies**

|**Sharding Type**|**Description**|**Use Case**|
|---|---|---|
|**Range-Based Sharding**|Divide data into shards based on a range of values (e.g., `user_id 1-1000`, `1001-2000`).|Simple, but shards can become unbalanced.|
|**Hash-Based Sharding**|Use a **hash function** to evenly distribute data across shards. Example: `shard = hash(user_id) % total_shards`.|Ensures even distribution, but hard to add new shards.|
|**Geo-Based Sharding**|Shard based on geographic location (`USA`, `Europe`, `Asia`).|Reduces network latency for users in different regions.|
|**Directory-Based Sharding**|A lookup table maps each record to a specific shard.|Highly flexible but requires extra storage for mapping.|

---

## **5️⃣ Challenges of Sharding**

|**Challenge**|**Description**|**Solution**|
|---|---|---|
|**Complex Queries**|Joins across shards are difficult.|Use denormalization or application-level joins.|
|**Rebalancing**|Adding a new shard requires moving data.|Use **consistent hashing** or **dynamic sharding**.|
|**Data Consistency**|Transactions across shards are hard to manage.|Use **distributed transactions** or avoid cross-shard writes.|

## **6️⃣ Real-World Use Cases**

🔹 **Twitter** → Shards tweets based on user ID for scalability.  
🔹 **Instagram** → Uses sharding for user profiles and media storage.  
🔹 **Amazon** → Shards product inventory by region.  
🔹 **MongoDB / Cassandra** → Natively support sharding for distributed data storage.

## **7️⃣ Sharding vs. Replication**

|**Feature**|**Sharding**|**Replication**|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Split data across servers|Copy the same data to multiple servers|
|**Scaling**|Horizontal (better for large data)|Read scaling only|
|**Fault Tolerance**|High (data is distributed)|High (data is redundant)|
|**Performance**|Better for write-heavy workloads|Better for read-heavy workloads|

---

## **🔹 Summary**

✅ **Sharding distributes large databases across multiple servers**, improving **scalability and performance**.  
✅ **Types of sharding**: Range-based, Hash-based, Geo-based, Directory-based.  
✅ **Challenges include query complexity, data rebalancing, and consistency management**.  
✅ **Used by large-scale applications like Twitter, Amazon, and Instagram**.
