Ah, nice — you're stepping into **database internals** now. Understanding **transaction isolation levels** is super important when designing systems that require **concurrency**, **data integrity**, and **performance tuning**.

---

## 💡 What Are Transaction Isolation Levels?

Transaction **isolation levels** define **how concurrent transactions interact with each other**, specifically:

- **What one transaction can "see" of another's data**.
    
- How to balance between **data correctness** and **performance**.
    

They’re a part of the **ACID** properties (specifically the "I" in **Isolation**) in SQL databases.

---

## 🧪 The Problem: Concurrent Transactions

Let’s say two users are accessing and modifying the same data at the same time:

- Will they **see each other’s changes**?
    
- Could one transaction **overwrite another**?
    
- Could they both **read stale or half-updated data**?
    

That’s where isolation levels come in.

## 🔒 ANSI SQL Standard Isolation Levels

There are **four** official levels, ranked from weakest to strongest:

|Isolation Level|Prevents Dirty Reads|Prevents Non-Repeatable Reads|Prevents Phantom Reads|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Read Uncommitted**|❌|❌|❌|
|**Read Committed**|✅|❌|❌|
|**Repeatable Read**|✅|✅|❌|
|**Serializable**|✅|✅|✅|

---

## 🕳 Let's Understand the Problems They Solve

### 🔹 1. **Dirty Read**

- A transaction reads **uncommitted changes** made by another.
    
- ❌ Bad: What if that other transaction rolls back?
    

> Example: Transaction A sets balance to ₹0, Transaction B reads it before A commits. B acts on incorrect info.

---

### 🔹 2. **Non-Repeatable Read**

- A transaction reads the **same row twice** and gets **different values**.
    
- Happens when another transaction modifies the row between your reads.
    

> Example: You check product stock — 10 items. Another user buys 5. You check again — now it’s 5.

---

### 🔹 3. **Phantom Read**

- A transaction runs the **same query twice**, but the **result set changes** because new rows were added/removed.
    

> Example: You query “all orders above ₹1000”. Midway, another transaction adds such an order. On re-run, more results appear.

## 📘 Isolation Level Breakdown

---

### 1. 🔓 **Read Uncommitted** (Lowest)

- You can read uncommitted data (a.k.a. _dirty reads_).
    
- Fast, low locking overhead.
    
- Used in analytical workloads where exact accuracy is not critical.
    

---

### 2. ✅ **Read Committed** (Default in PostgreSQL, Oracle)

- Can only read **committed** data.
    
- Prevents dirty reads.
    
- But allows:
    
    - **Non-repeatable reads**
        
    - **Phantom reads**
        

> Safer than Read Uncommitted, but still allows some anomalies.

---

### 3. ♻️ **Repeatable Read** (Default in MySQL/InnoDB)

- Ensures:
    
    - No dirty reads
        
    - No non-repeatable reads (same row reads same value)
        
- But **phantom reads can still happen** unless special locks are used.
    

---

### 4. 🧱 **Serializable** (Highest Level)

- Full isolation — transactions are executed **as if they happened one after another**, serially.
    
- Prevents **all anomalies**.
    
- But:
    
    - Much slower
        
    - More locking & blocking
        

---

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're editing a Google Sheet:

|Isolation Level|Analogy|
|---|---|
|Read Uncommitted|You can see everyone's typing even if they’re not saved|
|Read Committed|You see others’ changes only after they click "Save"|
|Repeatable Read|You work on a frozen snapshot of the sheet rows|
|Serializable|Only one person edits at a time|

---

## 🔄 Isolation in PostgreSQL vs MySQL vs SQL Server

|DBMS|Default Isolation|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|PostgreSQL|Read Committed|Uses MVCC (no locks for reads)|
|MySQL/InnoDB|Repeatable Read|But doesn’t fully protect from phantom reads|
|SQL Server|Read Committed|Uses locks for reads unless configured otherwise|

---

## 🧪 Summary Table

|Level|Dirty Read|Non-Repeatable Read|Phantom Read|Use Case|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Read Uncommitted|✅|✅|✅|Analytics, not critical|
|Read Committed|❌|✅|✅|Most business apps|
|Repeatable Read|❌|❌|✅|Inventory, reports|
|Serializable|❌|❌|❌|Banking, ledger systems|
