Relational databases are a type of database that organizes and stores data in a structured format using **tables**. These tables consist of rows and columns, where rows represent individual records, and columns define attributes or fields for those records. The primary strength of relational databases lies in their ability to establish and manage relationships between different tables, making them highly efficient for organizing interconnected data.

### **Key Features of Relational Databases**

1. **Tables as the Core Structure:**
    
    - Data is stored in tabular form, with each table having a defined schema (structure).
    - Example: A "Users" table might have columns like `UserID`, `Name`, `Email`, and `Age`.
2. **Relationships Between Tables:**
    
    - Relational databases allow tables to be related to one another using **keys**:
        - **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each record in a table.
        - **Foreign Key:** A field in one table that references the primary key in another, establishing a relationship.
3. **SQL (Structured Query Language):**
    
    - Relational databases use SQL to interact with and manipulate data.
    - Examples of SQL queries include retrieving data (`SELECT`), inserting data (`INSERT`), updating records (`UPDATE`), and deleting data (`DELETE`).
4. **Data Integrity:**
    
    - Ensure data accuracy and consistency through rules like constraints.
    - Examples include **unique constraints** (no duplicate entries) or **not null constraints** (mandatory fields).
5. **ACID Properties:**
    
    - Relational databases follow ACID principles to guarantee reliable transactions:
        - **Atomicity:** All operations in a transaction succeed, or none do.
        - **Consistency:** The database remains in a valid state before and after a transaction.
        - **Isolation:** Transactions occur independently of one another.
        - **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, it is permanently stored.

### **Advantages of Relational Databases**

- **Structured and Organized:** Ideal for structured data with clear relationships.
- **Flexibility:** SQL provides powerful querying capabilities.
- **Data Integrity:** Strong rules ensure data consistency.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for many types of applications with moderate data growth.
