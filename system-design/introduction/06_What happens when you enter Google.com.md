Entering "google.com" into a browser triggers a complex sequence of events that allows your device to display Google's homepage. Here's a breakdown of what happens:

### **1. Domain Name System (DNS) Lookup**

- Your browser first checks if it already knows the IP address for "google.com" from its cache.
- If not, it queries the DNS server to find the IP address associated with "google.com." DNS acts like a phonebook for the internet, translating human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses.

### **2. Establishing a Connection**

- Once your browser has the IP address, it needs to connect to Google's server. This involves the **Transport Layer** protocols:
    - A **TCP connection** (Transmission Control Protocol) is initiated between your device and Google's server.
    - To secure the connection, HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) establishes an **SSL/TLS handshake**, ensuring encrypted communication.

### **3. Sending an HTTP Request**

- Your browser sends a **GET request** to Google's server. The request asks for the resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) needed to load the webpage.

### **4. Server Processing**

- Google's server processes the request, retrieves the necessary resources, and sends back an **HTTP response**. This response includes:
    - The **status code** (e.g., `200 OK` for success).
    - The content of the page, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly images.

### **5. Rendering the Webpage**

- Your browser receives the HTTP response and begins rendering the webpage:
    - **HTML:** Provides the structure of the page.
    - **CSS:** Adds styling to the page, like colors and fonts.
    - **JavaScript:** Enables interactive features, such as autofill or dynamic search results.

### **6. Additional Requests**

- While rendering the page, your browser might discover external resources (e.g., images, fonts, or scripts) linked in the HTML. It sends additional requests to retrieve them.
- These requests might be cached or fetched from Google's servers or a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

### **7. User Interaction**

- Once the rendering is complete, you see Google's homepage. You can interact with it (e.g., type a search query), and the cycle begins again for subsequent actions.

### **Optimizations by Google**

- Google employs techniques like caching, load balancing, and CDNs to ensure fast response times, reliability, and scalabilityâ€”even under heavy traffic.
