**Anomaly Detection** in distributed systems refers to identifying **unusual patterns or behaviors** that deviate from the norm â€” often indicating a bug, system degradation, performance issue, or security breach.

In large-scale systems, early detection of anomalies is crucial to **prevent cascading failures**, **reduce downtime**, and **maintain SLAs**.

## ðŸ§  Why Is It Challenging?

In distributed systems:

- Logs, metrics, and traces come from **many independent services**
    
- Data is **high volume, high velocity**
    
- "Normal" behavior is **complex and dynamic**
    
- Anomalies may be **context-dependent** (e.g., spikes during traffic surges are fine... until they're not)

## ðŸ§¨ Common Anomalies to Detect

|Type|Examples|
|---|---|
|**Latency spikes**|Requests taking unusually long|
|**Error rate surges**|Sudden increase in 500s or timeouts|
|**Traffic anomalies**|DDoS attacks, traffic drop, or unexpected spikes|
|**CPU/memory leaks**|Gradual but unexpected growth|
|**Data drift**|Unexpected changes in schema, volume, or content|
|**Resource saturation**|Disk space, thread pools, DB connections maxed out|

## ðŸ›  Techniques for Anomaly Detection

### 1. **Threshold-based Alerts**

- Set static or dynamic thresholds (e.g., "Alert if latency > 2s")
    
- Simple, fast, but **limited context awareness**
    

---

### 2. **Statistical Methods**

- Moving average, standard deviation, z-score
    
- Detect anomalies by comparing against historical trends
    

```python
if current > mean + 3 * std_dev:
    alert()
```

---

### 3. **Machine Learning-based**

- Supervised: Train models on known anomalies
    
- Unsupervised: Use clustering, autoencoders, isolation forests to find outliers
    
- Can detect complex patterns across **multiple signals**
    

---

### 4. **Log Analysis + NLP**

- Parse logs using regex or structured logging
    
- Use NLP or embeddings to detect log message anomalies
    
- Good for detecting **rare error messages**
    

---

### 5. **Tracing + Contextual Anomaly Detection**

- Use **distributed tracing** (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) to track request paths
    
- Detect outliers in **span durations**, **error traces**, or **dependency chains**

## ðŸ“¦ Tools for Anomaly Detection

|Tool|Description|
|---|---|
|**Prometheus + Alertmanager**|Basic thresholds and anomaly rules|
|**Grafana Loki / Tempo**|Visualization + log/tracing correlation|
|**ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**|Powerful log analytics|
|**Datadog / New Relic / Dynatrace**|APM with built-in anomaly detection|
|**Anodot, Splunk ITSI**|AI-driven anomaly monitoring|
|**Python libs**: `scikit-learn`, `PyOD`, `prophet`, `isolation-forest`|Custom anomaly detection|

## ðŸ§© Example: Latency Anomaly Detection (Z-score method)

```python
import numpy as np

# Historical latency in ms
latencies = [300, 320, 290, 305, 310, 1500]  # last value is abnormal

mean = np.mean(latencies[:-1])
std_dev = np.std(latencies[:-1])
z_score = (latencies[-1] - mean) / std_dev

if z_score > 3:
    print("ðŸš¨ Anomaly detected: Latency spike")
```

---

## âœ… Best Practices

- Combine **metrics, logs, and traces**
    
- Detect **multi-variate anomalies** (e.g., high CPU + high error rate)
    
- Use **baselining** per service and per time-window
    
- Add **auto-remediation hooks** (e.g., restart, scale up)
    
- Implement **blackbox + whitebox monitoring**
