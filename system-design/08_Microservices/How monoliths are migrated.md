Great question — this is a really valuable topic for system design interviews and real-world architecture planning. Let’s go through **how monoliths are migrated to microservices**, in a clean, structured, detailed way.

## 📖 How Monoliths Are Migrated to Microservices — Complete Guide

---

### 📌 1. **Why Migrate?**
You typically consider migration when:
- The monolith is becoming too large and complex to manage.
- Different parts need independent scaling.
- Deployment cycles are getting slower.
- Teams are blocked by code dependencies.
- Tech stack limitations prevent innovation.

---

### 📌 2. **Migration Strategies**

Here are common, proven migration strategies:

| Strategy                   | Description                                                                                  | Use Case                         |
|:---------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
| **Strangler Fig Pattern**    | Gradually replace parts of the monolith with microservices, routing traffic through a proxy. | Low-risk, iterative replacement. |
| **Modular Monolith First**   | Break the monolith internally into clear modules/packages, then extract services one-by-one. | When you need intermediate steps.|
| **Vertical Slice Migration** | Split by business domains (verticals) — e.g., “User Service,” “Order Service” — then migrate. | Clear domain boundaries exist.   |
| **Feature-Driven Extraction**| New features are built as microservices, old monolith code stays until eventually deprecated. | When adding frequent new features.|

### 📌 3. **Step-by-Step Migration Process**

### **✅ Step 1: Identify Boundaries**
- Use **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** or business domain mapping.
- Example:
  - User Management
  - Orders & Payments
  - Notifications
  - Analytics

👉 Start by picking **low-risk, non-critical services** first.

---

### **✅ Step 2: Modularize the Monolith**
- Refactor the monolith into clear modules/libraries.
- Decouple dependencies between modules.
- This helps later extraction.

---

### **✅ Step 3: Build APIs for External Communication**
- Wrap monolith functionalities with **REST, gRPC, or messaging APIs**.
- Start routing traffic to services through a **reverse proxy or API Gateway**.

---

### **✅ Step 4: Gradually Extract Services**
- Extract one module into an independent microservice.
- Set up:
  - Independent database (if needed).
  - CI/CD pipelines.
  - Logging & monitoring.
  - Service discovery.

- Example: extract “User Profile” service first.

---

### **✅ Step 5: Data Ownership and Migration**
- Each microservice should manage its own data (Database-per-Service pattern).
- Techniques:
  - **Data replication**
  - **Event sourcing**
  - **Change data capture (CDC)**

- Avoid shared databases — leads to tight coupling.

---

### **✅ Step 6: Inter-Service Communication**
- Use **REST APIs, gRPC, or message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ)** for interaction.
- Implement **asynchronous communication** where possible for better decoupling.

---

### **✅ Step 7: Service Discovery & API Gateway**
- Introduce a **service discovery system (Consul, Eureka)**.
- Use an **API Gateway (Kong, NGINX, AWS API Gateway)** for unified routing and security.

---

### **✅ Step 8: Implement Distributed Infrastructure**
- CI/CD for independent deployments.
- Centralized logging (ELK, Loki)
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry)

---

### **✅ Step 9: Decommission Monolith Gradually**
- As services take over, disable corresponding modules in the monolith.
- Monitor traffic and system behavior.
- Fully remove modules only when confident.

---

### 📌 4. **Migration Challenges**
- **Data migration and consistency**
- **Distributed transactions (use Saga patterns)**
- **Operational complexity**
- **Debugging and monitoring distributed systems**
- **Network latency and failure handling**

---

### 📌 5. **Real-World Example: Uber**
- Started as a monolithic Node.js app.
- As growth exploded:
  - Introduced microservices in Go and Java.
  - Used APIs and Kafka for async communication.
  - Migrated services like Pricing, Ride Matching, and Payments independently.
  - Gradually reduced monolith dependencies.

---

### 📌 6. **Visual Migration Flow**

```
[Client]
   ↓
[API Gateway / Reverse Proxy]
   ↓                  ↘
[Monolith (legacy)]     [Microservice 1]
                        [Microservice 2]
                        [Microservice 3]
```

Over time, the monolith is phased out, leaving only microservices behind.

---

## ✅ Final Thought:
Migration is **not a one-shot project** — it’s a continuous, iterative process.
👉 Start small.
👉 Focus on business-critical services later.
👉 Balance between stability and innovation.
