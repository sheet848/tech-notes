**Short-circuiting** in JavaScript refers to the logical evaluation of expressions involving the `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) operators. These operators work in a way where they stop (or "short-circuit") evaluating further as soon as the result of the expression is determined. This behavior can be leveraged for performance optimization and conditional execution.

### **How Short-Circuiting Works**

1. **Logical AND (`&&`):**
   - If the first operand is **falsy**, the entire expression is falsy, and the second operand is not evaluated.
   - If the first operand is **truthy**, the second operand is evaluated, and its value determines the result of the expression.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   const result = false && "Hello";
   console.log(result); // Output: false (short-circuits at the first operand)

   const result2 = true && "Hello";
   console.log(result2); // Output: "Hello" (evaluates second operand)
   ```

2. **Logical OR (`||`):**
   - If the first operand is **truthy**, the entire expression is truthy, and the second operand is not evaluated.
   - If the first operand is **falsy**, the second operand is evaluated, and its value determines the result.

   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   const result = true || "Hello";
   console.log(result); // Output: true (short-circuits at the first operand)

   const result2 = false || "Hello";
   console.log(result2); // Output: "Hello" (evaluates second operand)
   ```

### **Why Use Short-Circuiting?**
1. **Default Values:**
   Short-circuiting is often used to provide fallback or default values.
   ```javascript
   const username = input || "Guest";
   console.log(username); // If input is falsy, it defaults to "Guest".
   ```

2. **Conditional Execution:**
   Perform actions only when a condition is met.
   ```javascript
   isUserLoggedIn && loadUserProfile();
   // Executes `loadUserProfile()` only if `isUserLoggedIn` is truthy.
   ```

3. **Efficiency:**
   By stopping evaluation early, unnecessary operations are avoided, improving performance.

### **Truthy and Falsy Values in JavaScript**
Short-circuiting relies on the truthy or falsy nature of values:
- **Falsy Values:** `false`, `0`, `""` (empty string), `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`.
- **Truthy Values:** Everything else (e.g., non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, objects).

### **Short-Circuiting in Practice**

1. **Guard Clauses:**
   ```javascript
   const user = null;
   user && console.log(user.name); // Does not throw an error; short-circuits at `null`.
   ```

2. **Function Arguments:**
   ```javascript
   function greet(message) {
       console.log(message || "Hello!");
   }
   greet(); // Output: "Hello!" (uses default)
   greet("Hi there!"); // Output: "Hi there!"
   ```
