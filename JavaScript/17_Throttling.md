**Throttling** is a technique used to control the frequency of function execution. It ensures that a function is called at most once in a specified time interval, even if it's triggered multiple times. This is particularly useful for performance optimization in scenarios where an event is fired repeatedly, like scrolling, resizing, or typing.

### **How Throttling Works**
- When you apply throttling, the function execution is restricted to at most one call in a fixed time window.
- If the function is triggered again within the throttle delay, it will be ignored until the delay period has passed.

---

### **Use Cases**
- **Scrolling:** Optimize heavy operations like DOM manipulation when the user scrolls rapidly.
- **Window Resizing:** Handle events efficiently when resizing the browser window.
- **Button Clicks:** Prevent users from triggering an action multiple times quickly, like form submissions.
- **API Requests:** Limit API calls to avoid server overload.

### **Example Code**
Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of throttling using JavaScript:

#### **Using a Custom Throttling Function**
```javascript
function throttle(func, delay) {
    let lastCall = 0; // Keeps track of the last execution time

    return function (...args) {
        const now = new Date().getTime();

        if (now - lastCall >= delay) {
            lastCall = now;
            func(...args); // Execute the function
        }
    };
}

// Example: Throttling a scroll event
function onScroll() {
    console.log("Scroll event triggered!");
}

window.addEventListener("scroll", throttle(onScroll, 200)); // Limit scroll event to once every 200ms
```

#### **Using Lodash Throttle**
If you're using a library like Lodash, you can simplify the process:
```javascript
import _ from "lodash";

function onResize() {
    console.log("Window resized!");
}

window.addEventListener("resize", _.throttle(onResize, 200)); // Uses Lodash's throttle function
```

### **Throttle vs Debounce**
- **Throttle:** Ensures the function is called at a fixed interval, even if triggered frequently.
- **Debounce:** Ensures the function is called only after a specified delay from the last trigger.

| **Aspect**    | **Throttle**                                 | **Debounce**                              |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Use Case**  | Limit executions to once every X ms.          | Execute only after a burst of events ends.|
| **Example**   | API polling, scroll handling.                 | Search suggestions, form validation.      |
