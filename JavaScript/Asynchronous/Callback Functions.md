- The callback function in JavaScript is regularly passed as an argument of another function. 
- The callback function can be called inside the parent function after completing the particular task in the parent function. 
- It is mainly used to handle the asynchronous operations.

## Need for the Callback Function

- When you need to fetch the data from API, load images, or perform any asynchronous operations, it can take time and block the execution of the other code.
- In such cases, you can use the callback function to execute the code, which must be executed after the asynchronous operation, and you can execute the other code without blocking it.

## Nesting Callbacks and Callback Hell

If the first function is dependent on the data of the second function, and the second function is dependent on the data of the third function, you may require the nested callback function.

Due to its complex syntax of the nested callback, itâ€™s also called the callback hell.

Whenever you need to use the nested callback functions, you can use the promises or async/await to write the simpler code.
