## Timing Events

- JavaScript timing events are used to execute the code after a specified time only once or multiple times. 
- In JavaScript, you can use the timing events to control when a particular task should be executed.
- The 'window' object contains the various methods for timing events, which you can use to schedule the tasks. 
- You can call these methods using the window object or without using it.
