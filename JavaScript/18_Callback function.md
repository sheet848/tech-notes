A **callback function** in JavaScript is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation or event has been completed. Callbacks allow asynchronous programming, enabling tasks like making API calls, handling events, and performing operations without blocking the main thread.

### **How It Works**
1. You define a callback function.
2. Pass it as an argument to another function.
3. That function calls the callback after its own operations are done.

---

### **Synchronous Callback Example**
In this case, the callback is executed immediately as part of the current execution flow:
```javascript
function greet(name, callback) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    callback();
}

function sayGoodbye() {
    console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greet("Sheetal", sayGoodbye); 
// Output:
// Hello, Sheetal!
// Goodbye!
```

---

### **Asynchronous Callback Example**
Used in cases like API requests or setTimeout where the callback executes later:
```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Data fetched!");
        callback();
    }, 2000); // Simulates a delay
}

function processData() {
    console.log("Processing data...");
}

fetchData(processData); 
// Output after 2 seconds:
// Data fetched!
// Processing data...
```

---

### **Why Use Callback Functions?**
1. **Asynchronous Operations:** They allow handling tasks like API calls, timers, and event listeners without blocking execution.
2. **Code Reusability:** You can define generic functions and pass custom logic as callbacks.
3. **Event-Driven Programming:** Many browser events (clicks, keypresses, etc.) rely on callbacks.

### **Callback Hell**
When you chain multiple callbacks, the code can become hard to read and maintain. This is called "callback hell":
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Step 1");
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Step 2");
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("Step 3");
        }, 1000);
    }, 1000);
}, 1000);
```

#### **Solution:**
Use **Promises** or **async/await** for cleaner code structure. For example:
```javascript
function delay(ms) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

async function steps() {
    await delay(1000);
    console.log("Step 1");
    await delay(1000);
    console.log("Step 2");
    await delay(1000);
    console.log("Step 3");
}

steps();
```
