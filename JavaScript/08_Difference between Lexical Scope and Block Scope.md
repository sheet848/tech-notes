Lexical scope and block scope are related concepts in JavaScript, but they differ in their purpose and behavior. Here's how they compare:

---

### **1. Lexical Scope:**
- **Definition:** Lexical scope refers to how variable access is determined by the physical placement of the code during its definition, not runtime. It is related to function and variable declarations in the source code.
- **Determination:** A function can access variables that were defined in its parent scope when it was created, no matter where the function is called.
- **Scope Level:** It's primarily about **function-level and global-level scope**.
- **Example:**
    ```javascript
    function outer() {
        const outerVar = "Outer";

        function inner() {
            console.log(outerVar); // Accesses outerVar from the outer lexical scope
        }

        inner();
    }

    outer(); // Logs: "Outer"
    ```
    - `inner` can access `outerVar` because of lexical scoping.

---

### **2. Block Scope:**
- **Definition:** Block scope confines variables declared with `let` or `const` to the specific block (enclosed by `{}`) in which they are declared.
- **Determination:** It is specific to **block-level declarations** and ensures variables are not accessible outside of their block.
- **Scope Level:** Exists within individual blocks (`if`, `for`, `while`, etc.) and functions.
- **Example:**
    ```javascript
    {
        let blockVar = "Inside block";
        console.log(blockVar); // Accessible here
    }
    console.log(blockVar); // ReferenceError: blockVar is not defined
    ```
    - `blockVar` is only available inside the block `{ }`.

### **Key Differences:**
| **Aspect**             | **Lexical Scope**                                       | **Block Scope**                                         |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope Type**         | Determined by where functions and variables are defined | Determined by `{}` blocks (e.g., `if`, `for`, etc.)    |
| **Variables Affected** | Applies to variables/functions in parent-child relation | Applies to variables declared with `let` and `const`   |
| **Access**             | Variables can be accessed if within the same lexical chain | Variables outside the block are not accessible         |

### **Relationship Between Lexical and Block Scope:**
Block scope often interacts with lexical scope when variables are declared in blocks. For example:
```javascript
function example() {
    const outerVar = "Outer";

    if (true) {
        let blockVar = "Block";
        console.log(outerVar); // Accessible due to lexical scope
        console.log(blockVar); // Accessible due to block scope
    }

    console.log(blockVar); // ReferenceError: blockVar is not defined
}

example();
```

In this case:
- `outerVar` is accessible due to **lexical scoping**.
- `blockVar` is restricted to the `if` block due to **block scoping**.
