**Debouncing** is a programming technique used to control the execution of a function so that it is invoked only after a specified delay has passed since the last time the event was triggered. This is particularly helpful for scenarios where events are triggered in quick succession, such as typing in a search bar, resizing a window, or scrolling.

---

### **How Debouncing Works**
1. When an event is triggered (e.g., a `keyup` event while typing), a timer is started.
2. If the event is triggered again before the delay period is over, the timer resets.
3. The function is executed only if the delay period has elapsed without the event being triggered again.

### **Use Cases**
- **Search Input:** Sending API requests only after the user stops typing for a moment.
- **Window Resize:** Executing a function after the user stops resizing the window.
- **Scroll Tracking:** Running animations or triggering actions when scrolling stops.

### **Debouncing Example**
Hereâ€™s an implementation of a custom debounce function:

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
    let timeoutId; // Store the timer ID
    return function (...args) {
        clearTimeout(timeoutId); // Clear any previous timer
        timeoutId = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay); // Set a new timer
    };
}

// Example: Debouncing an input event
const searchInput = document.getElementById("search");

function performSearch(query) {
    console.log("Searching for:", query);
}

const debouncedSearch = debounce((event) => performSearch(event.target.value), 300);

searchInput.addEventListener("input", debouncedSearch);
```
In this example:
- The `performSearch` function is only executed 300ms after the user stops typing.
- If the user types rapidly, the timer resets each time, preventing redundant function calls.

### **Key Benefits**
- Reduces unnecessary or redundant function executions, improving performance.
- Prevents issues like flooding an API with too many requests.

### **Debounce vs Throttle**
| **Aspect**    | **Debounce**                                   | **Throttle**                                  |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Behavior**  | Executes the function only after the event stops triggering for a specified delay. | Ensures the function is executed at regular intervals, regardless of how frequently the event occurs. |
| **Use Case**  | Typing in a search bar (wait for user input to finish). | Tracking scroll events (restrict execution frequency). |
