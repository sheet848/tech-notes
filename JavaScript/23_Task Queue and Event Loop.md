The **task queue** and **event loop** are critical components of JavaScript's concurrency model, enabling it to handle asynchronous operations in a non-blocking manner. Here's a detailed breakdown of each concept and their relationship:

---

### **1. Task Queue**
- The **task queue** (or **callback queue**) is a data structure where callback functions from asynchronous operations are placed when they are ready to be executed.
- Examples of asynchronous operations that add callbacks to the task queue:
  - `setTimeout` or `setInterval`
  - DOM events (like `click` or `keyup`)
  - AJAX calls or `fetch`
- The callback functions in the task queue are executed only when the **call stack** is empty.

#### **How Tasks Are Queued:**
1. An asynchronous operation (e.g., `setTimeout`) is initiated.
2. When the operation completes, its callback is sent to the task queue.
3. The callback will remain in the task queue until the **event loop** transfers it to the call stack for execution.

---

### **2. Event Loop**
- The **event loop** is a mechanism that continuously monitors the **call stack** and the **task queue**.
- Its primary job is to ensure that the JavaScript program executes in a non-blocking way by managing the execution of queued tasks.

#### **How the Event Loop Works:**
1. If the **call stack** is empty, the event loop looks at the **task queue**.
2. It dequeues the first callback from the task queue and pushes it onto the call stack.
3. The callback is then executed, and once the call stack is empty again, the event loop repeats the process.

### **Illustration of Task Queue and Event Loop**
Consider the following code:
```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Task from setTimeout");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
```

#### Execution Steps:
1. **Synchronous Code:**
   - `console.log("Start")` is executed and logged to the console.
   - `setTimeout` schedules the callback and places it in the task queue after 0ms.
   - `console.log("End")` is executed and logged to the console.
2. **Asynchronous Code:**
   - After the synchronous code finishes, the event loop checks the task queue.
   - The callback from `setTimeout` is moved to the call stack and executed, logging `"Task from setTimeout"`.

**Output:**
```
Start
End
Task from setTimeout
```

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Call Stack:** Where functions are executed sequentially.
2. **Task Queue:** Holds callbacks for asynchronous tasks.
3. **Event Loop:** Manages the interaction between the call stack and the task queue.

---

### **Microtasks vs. Task Queue**
In addition to the task queue, JavaScript also has a **microtask queue** (used by promises and `MutationObserver`). Microtasks have higher priority than tasks and are executed before any task in the task queue.

Example:
```javascript
console.log("Start");

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log("Microtask");
});

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Task");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
```

**Output:**
```
Start
End
Microtask
Task
```

Here, the promise callback (a microtask) is executed before the `setTimeout` callback (a task).
