In Redux, selectors are functions used to retrieve specific pieces of data from the state object. They help abstract the process of accessing state data, making your code more modular, testable, and easier to maintain. Selectors are especially helpful when dealing with normalized state or when you want to compute derived data.

Here's a basic example of a selector:

```javascript
const selectTodos = (state) => state.todos;
```

### Advantages of Selectors:
1. **Encapsulation:** They hide the shape of the state object from components.
2. **Reusability:** You can reuse selectors across different parts of the application.
3. **Memoization:** With libraries like Reselect, selectors can be optimized to avoid unnecessary recomputations.
