JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML but is used with React to describe the structure of user interfaces. It's a convenient way to write React elements and components, making the code more readable and expressive.

### Key Features of JSX:

1. **HTML-like Syntax**:
    
    - JSX allows you to write elements in a way that looks like HTML.
        
    - Example:
```
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
```

**JavaScript Integration**:

- JSX allows you to embed JavaScript expressions directly into your markup using curly braces `{}`.
    
- Example:

```
const name = "Sheetal";
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
```

**Compiles to** `React.createElement`:

- Under the hood, JSX is transpiled into JavaScript code using tools like Babel. For example:

```
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
 |
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!');
```

**Attributes and Properties**:

- You can pass attributes to elements, similar to HTML, but some naming conventions differ (e.g., `className` instead of `class`, `onClick` for event handlers).
    
- Example:

```
const button = <button className="myButton" onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
```

**Children**:

- JSX allows you to define child elements inside a parent element.
    
- Example:

```
const parent = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Welcome to React!</p>
  </div>
);

```

### Benefits of JSX:

- **Improved Readability**: The HTML-like syntax is intuitive and easier for developers to understand.
    
- **Integration with JavaScript**: Seamlessly combines JavaScript logic with UI structure.
    
- **Error Prevention**: JSX provides helpful error messages during development if you make a typo or misuse components.
