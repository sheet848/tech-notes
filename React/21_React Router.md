React Router is a popular library for managing navigation in React applications. It enables developers to create single-page applications with seamless and dynamic routing, meaning the app can update its content without requiring a full page reload.

Here are some key features of React Router:

- **Dynamic Routing:** Routes are defined as React components, allowing them to be dynamically rendered based on the application's state.
    
- **Nested Routing:** You can define routes inside other routes, making it easier to create complex layouts.
    
- **URL Management:** It allows you to sync the UI with the browser's URL, enabling back/forward navigation and bookmarking.
    
- **Code Splitting:** Only loads the parts of the application required for a specific route, improving performance.
    
- **Declarative Syntax:** Routes are defined using JSX, making them intuitive and easy to maintain.

# How to Setup React Router

Setting up React Router in your React application is quite straightforward. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Install React Router**

First, install the React Router library using npm or yarn:

```
npm install react-router-dom
```

### 2. **Wrap Your App with** `BrowserRouter`

Import `BrowserRouter` from React Router and wrap your application's root component (usually in `index.js` or `App.js`):

```
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

### 3. **Define Routes**

Inside your `App.js` or another component, use the `Routes` and `Route` components to define paths for your application:

```
import React from "react";
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import About from "./pages/About";
import Contact from "./pages/Contact";

function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}

export default App;

```

### 4. **Create the Components**

Create the components for each route (e.g., `Home.js`, `About.js`, and `Contact.js` in the `pages` folder).

### 5. **Link Between Pages**

Use the `Link` component to navigate between pages without reloading the app:

```
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Navbar = () => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
    </nav>
  );
};

export default Navbar;

```


### 6. **Run Your App**

Start your development server and test your routes:

```
npm start
```
